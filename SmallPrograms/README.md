### Here are some Python programs that I completed
I completed them in

* ESC180 (Python)
* ESC190 (Data Structures & Algorithms)
* On my free time for fun

The programs include:

* Empirically analyzing the relationship between the height of a Binary Search Tree vs. the number of nodes: `BSTTree.py`
* A Tic Tac Toe game with simple AI optimizations: `TicTacToe.py`
* Web scraping using Python's urllib and requests modules: `mostCommon.py`
* Some linear algebra functions including Gaussian Elimination, determinant, and matrix multiplication: `linAlg.py` and `GaussianElim.py`

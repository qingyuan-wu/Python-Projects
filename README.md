# Python-Projects
Some Python projects I've completed.

* Small-Programs contains cool Python programs that I've completed in past labs and out of personal interest. These programs include linear algebra functions and a Tic Tac Toe game.
* Synonyms is a program that uses a large database of words and a [semantic similartiy algorithm](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5014006#:~:text=SEMANTIC%20SIMILARITY%20ALGORITHMS,-Semantic%20similarity%20measures&text=They%20are%20classified%20as%20corpus,elements%20(words%2C%20phrases).) to predict synonyms of a word.
